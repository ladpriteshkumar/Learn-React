# React-Interview-Question-Answer

## 1. What is React ?  
ReactJS, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, makes the development of UI components easy and modular.

## 2. fearures of React 
The key features of React are:

* **Component-based architecture:** A Component is the smallest unit in a React application. Anything that is to be rendered on the browser can be rendered through components. Components help in maintainability and re-usability.
* __Virtual DOM:__ React uses virtual DOM concept for DOM manipulation which improves the performance of the application.
* __Unidirectional data flow:__  Reactâ€™s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast and easy to debug.
* __JSX syntax:__ React used JSX syntax which is similar to XML and HTML syntax that makes it easy for writing markup and binding events in components. 
* __SEO performance:__ The SEO performance can be improved using the server-side rendering concept.  Isomorphic applications can be developed by using React which increases the SEO performance.

## 3. Difference between  React and Angular
  React  | Angular
------------- | -------------
React is a small view library  | Angular is a full framework
React covers only the rendering and event handling part	  | Angular provides the complete solution for front-end development
Presentation code in JavaScript powered by JSX | Presentation code in HTML embedded with JavaScript expressions
React's core size is smaller than Angular, so bit fast | Angular being a framework contains a lot of code, resulting in longer load time
React is very flexible | Angular has less flexibility
Great performer, since it uses Virtual DOM | Angular uses actual DOM which affects its performance
