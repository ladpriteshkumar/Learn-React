  React  | Angular
------------- | -------------
React is a small view library  | Angular is a full framework
React covers only the rendering and event handling part	  | Angular provides the complete solution for front-end development
Presentation code in JavaScript powered by JSX | Presentation code in HTML embedded with JavaScript expressions
React's core size is smaller than Angular, so bit fast | Angular being a framework contains a lot of code, resulting in longer load time
React is very flexible | Angular has less flexibility
Great performer, since it uses Virtual DOM | Angular uses actual DOM which affects its performance
